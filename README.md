# GeoTrash
GeoTrash is about locating roadside trash for pickup.

Ever get frustrated seeing so much trash while driving on or walking along a road and feeling helpless to do anything about it?
Tires, mattresses, empty cups and fast food bags: we all want to help out and remove it but there's just so much. I really appreciate the environmental groups and clean up days but they are to far between. 

What if there were an App with which you could quickly identify the type of trash and mark it for removal? What if you could be rewarded for removing it? What if those at the source of the trash were, at least partially, held responsible? I know those who litter are to blame but shouldn't the fast food stores and coffee shops and beverage companies share some of the responsibility. Even if they were simply made
aware of the amounts of trash they are the source of they be more inclined to participate in cleanup or offer rewards for its removal.

With a couple of clicks or voice commands, the GeoTrash project will provide the means to identify roadside trash, its type, location, date seen and who identified it, and/or removed it or confirmed it's removal. Individuals, local removal services or clean up groups can list and locate marked trash on a map and plan a route for efficient pickup.

Working together, let's build a utility to make our environment a little cleaner. Thanks
